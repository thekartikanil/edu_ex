## Queue Data Structure Quiz

### Explanation

A **queue** is a linear data structure that operates on the **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** principle. It functions like a waiting line, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. This makes it ideal for scenarios where order matters and elements are processed in the sequence they were received.

**Key Operations:**

* **Enqueue (Insert):** Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
* **Dequeue (Delete):** Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
* **Peek:** Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
* **Empty:** Checks if the queue is empty.
* **Full:** Checks if the queue is full (only applicable for array-based implementation).

**Applications:**

* **Task Scheduling:** Queues are used to manage tasks in operating systems, where tasks are executed in the order they are submitted.
* **Data Transfer:** In network communication, queues are used to buffer data packets before being sent over the network.
* **Simulations:** Queues can simulate real-world systems like waiting lines at banks or supermarkets.
* **Priority Queues:** A variant of queues that prioritizes elements based on certain criteria, used for event processing and scheduling.
* **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** A graph traversal algorithm that utilizes a queue to explore nodes at each level of the graph.

**Implementations:**

Queues can be implemented using:

* **Arrays:**  This implementation is efficient for small queues but might require resizing if the queue exceeds the array size.
* **Linked Lists:** This implementation provides dynamic resizing, making it suitable for large queues.

**Examples:**

* Imagine a customer service call center where customers wait in line.  The first customer to call is the first one to be served, following the FIFO principle.
* In a printing queue, documents are printed in the order they are submitted to the printer.
